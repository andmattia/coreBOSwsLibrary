coreBOS Web service client library for Svelte
=======

import the functions you need:

`import {setURL, doLogin, doQuery} from './cbwsclient.svelte';`

call `setURL` and `doLogin`, and from then on use the library function as as required.

The library depends on the `md5` library which must be in the same directory as the coreBOS library.

Besides the two library files, in this directory you will find a fully functional autocomplete application as an example of usage.
